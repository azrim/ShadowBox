# FHE Circuit: Eligibility Evaluation
# This is a placeholder configuration for the FHE eligibility circuit
#
# Inputs (encrypted):
#   - balance: euint64
#   - nftFlags: euint32 (bitfield)
#   - interactions: euint32
#   - sybilScore: euint32 (scaled by 10000)
#
# Outputs:
#   - eligible: ebool
#
# Logic (pseudocode):
#   eligible = (balance >= threshold_balance) AND
#              (nftFlags & required_flags != 0) AND
#              (interactions >= min_interactions) AND
#              (sybilScore <= max_sybil_score)
#
# Threshold values (configurable):
#   threshold_balance: 1000000000000000000 (1 ETH in wei)
#   required_flags: 0x01 (at least one NFT)
#   min_interactions: 5
#   max_sybil_score: 2000 (0.2 scaled by 10000)
